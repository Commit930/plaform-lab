Variable is nothing but like a box where you store your information.
Python stores it as an object.
if checks the condition is true or not, 
if it is true: runs the block under if
if it is false: skips the if and else will run( if it is present)
try/except is used to catch the errors.  int("three") will cause a Valueerror, so we catch it using except.
